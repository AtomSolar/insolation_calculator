# Insolation Calculator

Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface, measured in W/m2.

This module allows a user to check for the average solar radiation at a specific latitude over a given number of years.

Most of the work has been done by the [climlab](https://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This a wrapper class that I hope to use more often in the future.
